In this project, I used Unity to develop a simple Island generator. The islands are generated using my own implementation of the Perlin noise algorithm, combined with a falloff technique that ensures the border of the map is always water.

Additionally, I implemented a raytracing effect on the CPU, which applies shadows to all the pixels on the map, enhancing the visual realism of the generated islands.
