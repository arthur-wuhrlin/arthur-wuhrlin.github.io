This is a school group project that features 2D real-time fluid simulation. I was in charge of designing and implementing the 2D engine.

Additionally, I added a render pass for the game that takes the positions of the water particles and generates pixel art-styled visuals. This entire process is exclusively done on the GPU using Compute Shaders.
