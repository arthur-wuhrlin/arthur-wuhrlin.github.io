      <p>In this project, I used Unity to develop a simple Island generator. The islands are generated using my own implementation of the Perlin noise algorithm, combined with a falloff technique that ensures the border of the map is always water.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I implemented a raytracing effect on the CPU, which applies shadows to all the pixels on the map, enhancing the visual realism of the generated islands.</p>

      <p>This project is an implementation and improvement of J. Tessendorf's paper 'Simulating Ocean'. It is built upon a simple 2D OpenGL engine that I implemented following TheCherno tutorials. I added some elements to be able to render in 3D.</p>
      <p>The goal was to simulate the height of a 'part' of the ocean, which means that there is no advanced water rendering, only a flat plastic shader. The height generation is done by generating a spectrum and applying a 2D Inverse Fourier Transform. This is all done on the GPU using Compute Shaders for obvious performance reasons.</p>

      <p>This is a school group project that features 2D real-time fluid simulation. I was in charge of designing and implementing the 2D engine.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I added a rendering pass for the game that takes the positions of the water particles and generates pixel art-styled visuals. This entire process is exclusively done on the GPU using Compute Shaders.</p>
