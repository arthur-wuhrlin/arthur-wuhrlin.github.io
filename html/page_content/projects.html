      <p>This project is an implementation and improvement of J. Tessendorf's paper 'Simulating Ocean'. It is built upon a simple 2D OpenGL engine that I implemented following TheCherno tutorials. I added some elements to be able to render in 3D.</p>
      <p>The goal was to simulate the height of a 'part' of the ocean, which means that there is no advanced water rendering, only a flat plastic shader. The height generation is done by generating a spectrum and applying a 2D Inverse Fourier Transform. This is all done on the GPU using Compute Shaders for obvious performance reasons.</p>

      <p>This is a school group project that features 2D real-time fluid simulation. I was in charge of designing and implementing the 2D engine.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I added a rendering pass for the game that takes the positions of the water particles and generates pixel art-styled visuals. This entire process is exclusively done on the GPU using Compute Shaders.</p>

      <p>In this project, I used Unity to develop a simple Island generator. The islands are generated using my own implementation of the Perlin noise algorithm, combined with a falloff technique that ensures the border of the map is always water.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I implemented a raytracing effect on the CPU, which applies shadows to all the pixels on the map, enhancing the visual realism of the generated islands.</p>

      <p> In this project, with three other students, we explore various method for personalized content synthesis applied to face generation using few user-specified samples. Namely, Custom Diffusion, Cross Initialization, LoRA and Textual Inversion. We also propose to combine the Custom Diffusion method with the Cross Initialization method and provide some evaluation metrics we used to assert the quality of the different methods used.
