    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hey ! I am a master student in Computer Science with a Major in Computer Graphics, and a minor in Machine Learning. I am interested by a broad variety of subjects.</p>
    <p>Firstly by The generation of visual content thanks to any science, be it Computer Science, Mathematics , Physics, ... and also for art purpose !</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rendering, it's very general but it really embraces this idea of generating visual content, here from some data of a scene;</li>
      <li>Raytracing, both real-time and offline, even though my Master's thesis is focused on real-time raytracing;</li>
      <li>Procedural Generation : I am really curious about some of the methods used in movies and video games to create realistic landscapes and lively worlds thanks to mathematics</li>
      <li>Generative Art : This is kind of similar to procedural generation, but the idea is to create piece of art using algorithms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="float:left">Secondly, I am really interested by low-level coding and computer architecture.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How does a computer work ? Both physically and logically (Learnt in L2).</li>
      <li>How is a GPU designed ? What really happens when I draw a triangle to the screen ?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a double diploma at both the National UNiversity of Singapore and Telecom Paris.</p>
    <p>In Singapore, I am doing a Master by research </p>
